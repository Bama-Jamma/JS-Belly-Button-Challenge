# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard


## Overview

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals the presence of various microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) in different individuals. This dashboard provides visualizations, including a horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart, to explore the top 10 OTUs found in each individual's belly button. Additionally, it displays the sample metadata, providing demographic information for each individual. The dashboard also includes a gauge chart showing the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual (bonus feature).

## Features

- Interactive Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual's belly button.

- Interactive Bubble Chart: Visualizes the microbial frequency in the selected individual's belly button.

- Demographic Information: Shows the demographic information of the selected individual.

- Weekly Washing Frequency Gauge (Bonus): Shows the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual on a gauge chart.

## Usage

1. Access the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://github.com/Bama-Jamma/JS-Belly-Button-Challenge.git).

2. Use the dropdown menu to select a specific individual by their Test Subject ID No.

3. Observe the charts and metadata update based on the selected individual.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure and layout of the dashboard.
- CSS: Styling and appearance of the dashboard.
- JavaScript: Data manipulation and interactivity of the charts.
- D3.js: Data visualization library used for creating the charts.
- Plotly.js: Interactive charting library used for creating the bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart.

## Installation
